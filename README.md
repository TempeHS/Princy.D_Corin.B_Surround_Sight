![An image of a cane, with an ultrasonic sensor attached to the front to measure distance from an object. The cane is 10 cm in length, and works with bluetooth, allowing sound to alert the user.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TempeHS/Princy.D_Corin.B_Surround_Sight/refs/heads/main/SurroundSight.png)

## initial concept and prototype
th inital desing of the surround sight was a shorter more begineer friendly cane designed to ack as training wheels of sorts to help kaia work through the motions of using a cane and become used to using a cane and she would eventually begin using a standard cane and naturally stop using the product. the prototype we eventually decided on focused on the the core concept of the design using a ultrasonic sensor and vibration motor to alert the patient to anythng they may touch within a meter.


## Additions we could add to our prototype
In our prototype, we wanted to add a sound sensor to our project. This is mainly because in some situations, the vibration motor would be too minute to notice. We however, failed to do this in the end because of the fact that we were not able to get the sound sensor working, and were not able to get the sensor to the volume we needed. We also wanted to implement a bluetooth module in our prototype, but we could not find the components and equipment for it. Additionally, we also wanted to add a functionality which changes the vibration motor's function from different distances.
